  Handle the replies under the user's own LinkedIn posts - draft answers to
  every comment, sorted by which ones are worth answering. Use when the user
  pastes the comments on their post, says "reply to these", "handle my
  comments", "someone said X on my post", or is dealing with a critic or a
  lead in the comments.

> 1. **Load the brain first.** If the PropFuel Marketing OS connector is available, call `get_knowledge` "LinkedIn - Master.md" before anything else, then the matching LinkedIn KB doc(s) for this job: algorithm-mental-model (named "LinkedIn KB - <topic>.md"; if a name doesn't match, check the knowledge list). The Master doc wins over the generic advice in this skill where they differ.
> 2. **Voice.** Use `~/.claude/linkedin/voice.md` if the person has one (their personal voice for their own profile). Otherwise, and always for the PropFuel company page, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/li-post/propfuel-voice.md`, which comes from the Brand Persona and Core Message masters.

Clients may be named without a live case study. No client quote or testimonial without written consent. Never post, comment, connect or send a DM: every skill ends with copy the person reads, approves and pastes themselves.
> 4. **Log it.** When a post, plan or audit is done, record one line in the OS with `log_update`.

# li-reply

The reply thread under your own post is where reach is actually decided. Every
reply is a second engagement event on the post, and the first hour of replies
does most of the work. But the value is not equal across comments, so this
skill sorts before it writes.

## Input

The user pastes the comments, ideally with names and roles. Screenshots are
fine. Do not scrape the thread with a browser tool.

## Triage first

Sort every comment into one of five buckets and say the count out loud:

| bucket | what it is | what it gets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LEAD** | someone describing the problem you solve | a real answer + a soft open door |
| **SUBSTANCE** | adds data, disagrees, extends | the longest reply on the thread |
| **PEER** | a name worth being seen next to | a reply that gives them something |
| **SUPPORT** | "great post", 🔥, a tag | a like, and a 3-8 word reply at most |
| **NOISE** | pitch, spam, bad faith | nothing, or one line and out |

Then write in that order, and stop writing when the value stops.

## How to reply

- **Answer the actual question.** If someone asks how, tell them how, in the
  reply. Do not send them to a DM to hear the answer they could have had.
- **Use their name once**, at the start, and never with an exclamation mark.
- **Match their length.** A two-line comment does not get a six-line reply.
- **To a critic:** concede the true part first, in their words, then hold the
  line on the part you believe. Never delete, never get defensive, never reply
  twice on the same thread.
- **To a lead:** answer fully in public. The open door is one sentence at the
  end, and it is an offer of help, not a pitch. Public value is what makes the
  next person DM you.
- **To a pitch in your comments:** ignore it. Replying gives it reach.

## Output

One block, grouped by bucket, each reply copy-ready and already humanized:

```
REPLIES  ·  17 comments  ·  1 LEAD, 3 SUBSTANCE, 4 PEER, 8 SUPPORT, 1 NOISE

LEAD
@Sarah Chen - "we have the same problem with proposals"
> The part that fixed it for us was pulling the pricing table out of the doc
> entirely and sending it as its own page. Cut a whole review round. Happy to
> send you the template if it is useful.

SUBSTANCE
@Marcus Webb - disagrees on cadence
> Fair, and 4x a week only worked because I had 8 months of posts behind it.
> From a standing start I would do what you said.

SUPPORT  (like these, reply to the first three)
@... "This is great" -> Thanks Dan.
...

NOISE  (1)
Skipped: an agency pitch. Replying gives it reach.
```

Then the gate: **nothing is posted until the user says yes.** They paste the
replies themselves.
